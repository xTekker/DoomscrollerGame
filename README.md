## Special Thanks
- The Codeblr Discord and Tumblr community for all their feedback, suggestions and encouragement.
- [FreeCodeCamp.org on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8lMTwSRoRg) - This video helped me gain a great understanding of Godot and gave me the confidence to start my own project, They have an amazing variety of tutorials and even programming language courses.
- [Clear Code on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAh_Kx5Zh5Q) - Their 11 hour video on Godot 4 is simply sublime, a work of art. It explains everything from what a Node and scene is and how to manipulate them, to how to create an animated sprite with player input controls.
